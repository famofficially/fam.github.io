Hi, 

My name is Farah, i am an artist& illustrator, based in PARIS. 
I love to illustrate, draw and paint, so i do digital and traditional artwork, i don't have a specific topic, i paint everything that inspires me ğŸŒ¸, my painting technique is mainly based on acrylic, oil, charcoal, felt, pencils, or graphic art and it's not overğŸ¤“...i try all the time experimenting new styles and new toolsğŸ”¬... My artwork is mainly in abstract and figurative painting. 
I hope they will in some way help you positively, encourage and inspire youğŸŒ». 
Best, Farah

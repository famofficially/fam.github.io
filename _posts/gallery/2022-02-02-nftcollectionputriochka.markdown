> Putriochka is a collection of 100 unique and hand made NFTs. <br>
2 NFT minted per week! <br>
>A week after the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian army, I had the idea to create a collection as an act of objection and condemnation of all acts of war on this land. The collection includes 100 unique NFTs (1 minted / day), each NFT tells sketches of the psychology of war including the common traits that characterize the main actors of the war that presumes in a few simple words: power, paranoia, pretentiousness, fear, motivation, betrayal, indifference, ambition and pride up to megalomania.. In each NFT, I implicitly use one or all of these words to tell a very brief story presented in a paradoxical, ironic, wacky and sometimes even satirical way, which is both imaginary and can be close to reality.

>MoonBoy is an NFT collection of 50 unique handmade NFTs, this collection chronicles moonboy's journey into the mysterious world of the Metaverse. <br>
>He makes us travel, see and discover through his eyes this fabulous world. "MoonBoy'' is a nod to cryptophiles and utopians who dream of a new libertarian and richer world ! We can perceive the metaverse as a parallel world where everything is allowed, its borders are only measured by the limit of our imagination.

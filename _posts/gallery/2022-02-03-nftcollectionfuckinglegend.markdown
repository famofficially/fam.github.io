> I present to you here my first NFT entitled « Fucking legend », it’s a tribute to probably the most important figures in the history of cryptocurrency, some of them are famous others are less known and some are unfortunately no longer in our world<br>
>I present them to you here from the person furthest to the left up to the most one to the right:<br>
>Len Sassaman: graduated from The Hill School in 1998. By 18, he was on the Internet Engineering Task Force responsible for the TCP/IP protocol underlying the internet and later the Bitcoin network. Vitalik Buterin: Co-founder of Ethereum. Elon Musk: He is so well known, I don’t think that he needs an introduction! Satoshi nakamoto: for Satoshi nakamoto, I used the reference relayed on the internet a few years ago even if we are still not sure who really behind this nickname, i found that since he made basically the news everywhere at the time and that his face is pretty uncommon that he deserves his place in this piece. Michael J. Saylor: is an American entrepreneur and business executive, who co-founded and leads MicroStrategy that used $250 million from its cash stockpile to purchase 21,454 Bitcoin. As of February 24, 2021 holdings include 90,531 bitcoins. Saylor disclosed he personally held 17,732 bitcoin. Nick Szabo: is computer scientist, he designed a mechanism for a decentralized digital currency he called “bit gold”.Bit gold was never implemented, but has been called “a direct precursor to the bitcoin architecture. Prisoner: There are so many crooks in the history of crypto especially in the beginning, i wanted to put a reference here to the biggest one of them, i let your imagination choose which one is, im pretty sure you have already an idea This piece which presents a collective of portraits of these brilliant people mentioned above, was made with a reference to Rembrandt painting entitled « Syndics of the Drapers’ Guild », It is currently owned by the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. It has been described as his “last great collective portrait” <br>
>Let your imagination run wild mainly about the questions that may go through your mind, why are they together? what do they say that is so important?Who is emprisoned…<br>
>The acquirer of this unique NFT will receive a digigraphie too (physical one, signed) at home.
